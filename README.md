# Animated React Portfolio

Quick steps to run:

1. Create a React app (if you haven't): `npx create-react-app my-portfolio`
2. Replace the `src/` folder with the files from this ZIP.
3. Install router: `npm install react-router-dom`
4. Start the app: `npm start`

This project uses manual CSS files next to each component/page.
